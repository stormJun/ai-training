# Paged Attention from First Principles: A View Inside vLLM

*11 Sep, 2025*

Large language models (LLMs) are **trained** in highly parallel,
**compute-bound** workloads, but serving them is very different:
**inference** is **memory-bound** and sequential. Optimising inference
is critical because no one will use a chatbot that lags behind typing or
a tool that takes minutes to respond. On the business side, squeezing
more out of each GPU directly reduces costs and maximises ROI.

A key bottleneck is the **key-value (KV) cache**, which stores
contextual information during decoding. Prior systems wasted **60-80%**
of this memory due to fragmentation, limiting throughput.
**PagedAttention**, proposed by Kwon et al. in [Efficient Memory
Management for Large Language Model Serving with
PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06180), solves this by
borrowing the idea of virtual memory from operating systems. The result
is near optimal memory usage with under **4%** waste and **2-3x higher
throughput**.

In this post I will build up from first principles, starting with
training versus inference workloads, moving to naive KV caching, the OS
analogy, and finally how paged KV caching and PagedAttention make LLM
serving faster and more efficient. These techniques are already
supported in major inference systems such as
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [TensorRT
LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), and [Hugging Face
TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main).
In the appendix, I also go through other inference optimisation
techniques like continuous batching, speculative decoding, and touch
briefly on quantisation.

## LLM Training vs Inference

To understand the inference challenges, it helps to contrast how LLMs
are used in training versus how they are used in deployment. At a high
level, training is when the model learns from data, making predictions
by going forward through the network’s layers (the **forward pass**),
comparing those predictions to the known targets, calculating the
**loss** through a **loss function** (i.e. how far we are from the
correct predictions), and then adjusting the weights via
**backpropagation** and some form of gradient
descent.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote">
<img src="./paged_attention_assets/01_mlp.gif"
style="width:375px;max-width:none;display:block;margin:0 auto"
alt="MLP" /> That flow is the core of any neural network’s architecture,
the input moves left to right through the layers until the output is
compared to the target and the loss is calculated. The network then
flows in the opposite direction, each layer computing gradients for its
weights and passing error backwards until the first layer, at which
point we have gradients for all
parameters.<img src="./paged_attention_assets/02_blocks.webp"
style="width:330px;max-width:none;display:block;margin:0 auto"
alt="blocks" /> For each layer this means the forward step produces the
output that flows onward, while the backward step calculates gradients
for the weights and sends the error backwards.
<img src="./paged_attention_assets/03_opt.webp"
style="width:330px;max-width:none;display:block;margin:0 auto"
alt="opt" /> Once gradients are available, the optimiser updates the
weights using them along with its internal state, teaching the network
from its errors. One forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and
update makes a training step, repeated many times across **epochs** to
gradually improve predictions. Visuals taken from: [Data-Parallel

Training especially for large language models is extremely expensive in
terms of compute. Models at this scale are trained on massive clusters
of GPUs, TPUs, or other specialised accelerators like Cerebras Wafer
Scale<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote">

alt="Cerebras" /> On the left is a new AI chip from a startup named
Cerebras, the largest in production with 4 trillion transistors and
about 900,000 compute cores. In inference, it runs OpenAI’s GPT-OSS 120B
at around **2,700 tokens/sec** for both single-user and multi-user
setups. By comparison, NVIDIA Blackwell DGX B200 reaches about **900
tokens/sec** for one user and drops to **580 tokens/sec** with ten
users. For a breakdown of the hardware differences, see [this
talk](https://youtu.be/7GV_OdqzmIU?si=HW99JXE1MrLbMlTg) by Jean-Philippe
Fricker, the co-founder and chief system architect. You can also try
their [chat service](https://chat.cerebras.ai/) to get a feel for
high-throughput inference in practice. I think it’s a good primer to
understand what fast inference really looks like before we dig deep into
this blog. Just want to note that I have no affiliation with them.
Everything I write here is based on pure interest.  
</span>, Graphcore IPUs, or Tenstorrent hardware. Although NVIDIA GPUs
remain the most common choice today, training runs are more or less a
one-time expense, often costing tens of millions of dollars. Inference,
by contrast, is when we fix those learned weights and use the model to
generate predictions or responses for new inputs. While this distinction
sounds straightforward, the workflows differ significantly in practice,
and they require different optimisation strategies.

At the heart of all LLMs is the **transformer** architecture, introduced
in the [“Attention Is All You Need”](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
paper. Despite many variations and improvements since, it remains the
foundation of state-of-the-art models. On the left below is the original
**decoder-only** transformer, and on the right is the Llama-2 70B
architecture, which illustrates some of these later refinements:

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/04_transformers.svg"
style="width:70.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

The flow of the network starts from raw text whether that is training
data or actual prompts during inference. The model does not understand
human characters directly, so the first step is **tokenisation**. This
breaks the text down into a sequence of token ids that the model can
process. Each id is then mapped into a dense vector space through
**embeddings**, which gives the model a numerical representation of the
input. **Positional encodings** are added to these vectors as well so
that the model can tell where each token sits in the sequence.

From there, the sequence flows through the stack of transformer decoder
blocks. Each layer lets tokens interact with one another through
**multihead-attention** with a **causal mask** to preserve the
*autoregressive* property of language. This builds richer context before
passing through feedforward transformations that expand and filter
features. Networks also have **residual connections**, which add the
input of a layer back to its output so the signal does not fade, as well
as **normalisation** to stabilise the weights.

There are some architectural differences to note. For example, LLaMA-2
70B uses Grouped Query Attention (GQA), a variant of attention that
reduces memory demands. Most modern LLMs also place the normalisation
layer before each block rather than after, which is different from the
original Transformer. Still, the high-level flow remains the same:
tokenised input goes in, contextualised embeddings come out.

At the end of the stack, the model projects everything back onto the
vocabulary space, producing a distribution over the next possible
tokens. During training, this is compared to the ground truth next
tokens for every position in the sequence. This is why LLMs are often
described as being trained on **next token prediction tasks**. There are
further stages of training, such as reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF), which tune the model to respond in a more human-like
way as we experience in modern chat systems.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/05_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

To make this concrete before moving to inference, consider the example
sequence Coffee solves everything, with a start-of-sequence token
\[SOS\] at the beginning. We feed in the sequence, tokenised
appropriately<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote">
<img src="./paged_attention_assets/06_tokenised.webp"
style="width:250px;max-width:none;display:block;margin:0 auto"
alt="tokenised" /> This sequence for example is split into 4 tokens by
the GPT-4o tokeniser with ids \[90651, 6615, 3350, 28997\] respectively.
</span>, and at each position the model is asked to predict the next
word. \[SOS\] predicts Coffee, \[SOS Coffee\] predicts solves, \[SOS
Coffee solves\] predicts everything, and so on until the model predicts
an end-of-sequence token \[EOS\].

Now here is the crucial point. During training, we already know the full
sequence. This allows us to feed the entire sequence through the
transformer in a single forward pass. The causal mask ensures that token
$`t`$ does not attend to token $`t + 1`$, so the autoregressive property
is respected, but the predictions for all positions are computed in
parallel. GPUs excel at this parallelism, so their compute cores are
fully saturated with work. In other words, training is compute bound. By
**compute-bound**, we mean that increasing the raw computational power
of the hardware directly speeds up training, while memory bandwidth is
not the limiting factor

Inference is different in nature. The model does not see the future
tokens, so it cannot process the entire sequence in parallel after the
prompt. It must step through one token at a time, with each new token
appended to the context. That means the GPU is no longer crunching
large, dense matrix multiplications that are heavily optimised for AI
workloads across many tokens at once. Instead, it is handling small,
repeated steps dominated by memory access, loading model weights and
cached activations again and again.

This shift in workload is important. When the bottleneck moves from
heavy compute to frequent data movement, performance drops. Moving data
is always more expensive than doing math on it. This is why inference
tends to be **memory-bound**, while training remains compute-bound.

## The Two Phases of Inference

The entire inference process when a user sends a prompt is split into
two phases:

- **Prefill (prompt phase)**: The model reads the entire input prompt
  and prepares to generate the first token.
- **Decoding**: The iterative loop where tokens are produced one by one
  sequentially.

These two phases have very different characteristics and bottlenecks.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/07_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

**Prefill**

During prefill, the model can still leverage its parallelism to process
the prompt tokens. All the input tokens (say the prompt is N tokens
long) are fed through the transformer network together in one forward
pass. This is typically a large matrix multiplication workload which
keeps the GPU’s compute units busy. As a result, prefill is usually
compute bound. In fact, this process shares more of the characteristics
of training, without the backpropagation of course.

The output of this stage is the first predicted token by the model and a
set of key/value pair vectors stored for each attention layer of each
prompt token, commonly known as the **KV cache**. We will ignore this
for now and return to it later. For now, just assume the end of this
process is a new predicted token.

The time until this first token is predicted is an important inference
metric called **time to first token (TTFT)**. TTFT grows with prompt
length, since a longer prompt means more tokens to process and more
attention keys and values to compute before reaching the first
prediction. Although this scales with input size, it is generally not
the main problem in serving.

![TTFT](./paged_attention_assets/08_ttft.svg)

**Decoding**

After prefill, the LLM enters the **decode** stage where it generates
new tokens sequentially, one at a time. Each iteration of decode takes
the current sequence (which keeps growing as new tokens are appended)
and performs a forward pass to predict the next token. Unlike the
prompt, which is available in full, new tokens arrive strictly one after
another. Each decode step is inherently serial, so we cannot compute
token *t+1* until token *t* has been generated.

This makes decoding fundamentally different from prefill. It is not
compute bound in practice but rather memory-bound, since each new token
requires fetching the model weights and reading the stored KV cache from
memory. GPUs end up spending more time moving data than performing
computation.

Just as TTFT measures prefill, **Inter-token Latency (ITL)** measures
the average time it takes to generate each subsequent token during
decoding.

In interactive applications like chatbots, both **TTFT** and **ITL** are
critical. Users do not want to wait too long before seeing the first
response, and they also expect a smooth, reasonably fast stream of
tokens thereafter. Other important inference metrics include **Total
Latency (E2EL)** and **Token Generation
Time**.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span>  
<span class="sidenote">  
![InferenceMetics](./paged_attention_assets/09_inferencemetics.svg)  
Inference metrics viewed on a token generation process between a user
and an inference service.  
</span>

This two-phase breakdown also explains why serving many requests in
parallel is challenging: the prefill stage can be heavy but runs once
per request, whereas the decode stage can drag on (possibly hundreds of
tokens generated sequentially per request) and tie up resources. Many
LLM serving optimisations, such as **continuous batching**,
**speculative decoding**, and **prefill/decode scheduling**, aim to keep
the GPU busy across these phases without letting one slow request
bottleneck others. (I cover batching and speculative decoding in the
appendix. Similar to what we will see next with paged KV caching, these
techniques are implemented in modern inference systems such as vLLM and
TensorRT-LLM.)

![ITL](./paged_attention_assets/10_itl.svg)

## Why Decoding Needs KV Caching

Given the **sequential** nature of decoding, a naive approach to
generate output tokens would be prohibitively slow. If we had to
recompute every layer’s activations from scratch for the entire growing
sequence at each step, the workload would explode. In practice, we would
just be recomputing results that were already calculated earlier. We are
already **memory-bound**, so making things worse is not an option.

To see how wasteful naive decoding would be, consider some numbers.
Imagine a prompt of 1000 tokens and we want 100 tokens of output.
Without caching, the model would process the full 1000 tokens for the
first output, then 1001 for the next, then 1002 for the one after, and
so on, adding up to well over 100,000 token computations.

With caching, the model only needs to handle the 1000 prompt tokens once
and then compute each of the 100 new tokens on top, for a total of just
1,100 computations, nearly two orders of magnitude less work. The trick
is to avoid reprocessing tokens from earlier in the sequence: once the
prompt is processed, its intermediate results can be reused for all
future decoding steps. In practice, this is done simply by appending to
the K and V tensors.

### Key-Value (KV) Caching

A core optimisation in the decode phase is **KV caching**. Each new
token depends on the key and value tensors of all previous tokens. These
include both the input tokens’ K and V from prefill and any new K and V
generated during decoding. To avoid recomputing these tensors at every
step, they are **cached** in GPU memory. With each new token, the model
simply appends its fresh K and V to this running cache, and subsequent
steps read from it. The inference process would then look like this:

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/11_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

Where the cost comes from is not only the size of the cache but also the
memory-bandwidth cost of repeatedly loading and updating the large K and
V tensors. With standard multi-head attention, each head maintains its
own K and V, so both storage and bandwidth scale directly with the
number of heads. For large models, this makes the cache one of the main
bottlenecks in inference.

To reduce these costs, a number of attention mechanisms have been
proposed. They all aim to shrink the KV footprint or reduce memory
transfers, while preserving model quality as much as possible. I won't
go into details of each mechanism but here is a brief overview of the
most well-known ones:

- [**Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02150):
  All heads in a layer share a single set of K and V instead of
  maintaining their own. This significantly reduces both cache size and
  memory reads during decode, though it usually comes at some cost in
  model quality.

- [**Grouped Query Attention (GQA)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245):
  A middle ground between MQA and full multi-head attention. Query heads
  are split into groups, and each group shares one K and V. This keeps
  much of the efficiency benefit of MQA while retaining more of the
  accuracy of multi-head attention. LLaMA 2 is a well-known example that
  uses GQA.

More recent approaches go further by compressing K and V into latent
spaces<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none">
![MLA](./paged_attention_assets/12_mla.webp) In **MLA**, K and V are
compressed into a shared latent space reused by all heads. This cuts the
KV cache size, but it creates a scaling issue as the latent must be kept
whole on every GPU, so it cannot be sharded efficiently in distributed
inference. ![GLA](./paged_attention_assets/13_gla.webp) **GLA** fixes
this by splitting heads into groups, each with its own latent. Now the
cache divides naturally across GPUs, with each device holding only its
share. This enables parallelism without increasing per-device memory. By
collapsing K and V into low-rank projections, GLA also frees parameter
budget for wider projections or more query heads. The result is better
scaling, smoother latency across batches, and more hardware-friendly
efficiency, especially for long contexts or large workloads. </span>:

- [**Multi head Latent Attention
  (MLA)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434): Stores K and V in a
  learned low-dimensional latent space and projects in and out as
  needed. This can reduce KV cache size and bandwidth while trading a
  small amount of extra compute for the projections. This is famously
  used in DeepSeek V2 and later follow ups.

- [**Grouped Tied Attention (GTA)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21487):
  Ties keys and values within each group, reducing cache size and memory
  traffic at decode while maintaining GQA-level quality. The tied KV
  vectors are created using a single projection. The full vector is
  cached and used as the value (without rotation). For the key, only the
  first half is taken unrotated, while the second half comes from a
  separate one-head projection with RoPE, broadcast across groups. This
  halves the KV cache, cuts memory traffic, and doubles arithmetic
  intensity compared to GQA.

- [**Grouped Latent Attention
  (GLA)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21487): Stores K and V in a latent
  representation optimised for efficient parallel sharding. This
  achieves MLA-like compression while being more hardware-friendly and
  more suitable for distributed inference.

## The Problem with Naive KV Caching

While KV caching solves the redundant recomputing issue, it shifts the
bottleneck heavily to memory and introduces significant memory
management problems as context lengths grow. Every active request grows
a trail of keys and values token by token, and that trail must live on
the GPU for fast reads during decode. As soon as we try to serve many
requests together using continuous batching for ex., throughput stops
being compute bound and becomes memory bound. This is mainly due to two
things: first, as the KV cache size grows, we are limited in how many
requests we can process together in a batch, which reduces throughput,
and second, when memory is not allocated efficiently, naive KV caching
leads to severe fragmentation, both internal and external.

### Memory scaling

The KV cache’s memory usage scales linearly with sequence length,
consuming substantial GPU memory. For each generated token, caches must
store a key and value vector per transformer layer and head. Let’s put
numbers on this with LLaMA-2–13B. The cache size can be estimated by:

``` math
KV_{cache\_ size} = 2\times bytes\times n_{layers}\times B\times n_{heads}\times d_{head}\times n_{seq}
```

where  
$`n_{layers}`$ = number of transformer layers (blocks)  
$`B`$ = batch size  
$`n_{heads}`$ = number of attention
heads<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote">For MQA
that reduces to just 1 and for GQA that depends on the number of
groups.</span>  
$`d_{head}`$ = per-head dimension  
$`n_{seq}`$ = sequence or context length  
2 = two caches per layer for Key and
Value<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote">This is
the main component MLA and GLA reduce, making that 1 instead of
2!</span>

Calculating using the formula we just stated, for LLaMA-2-13B in FP16 (2
bytes per element), with standard multi-head attention (40 layers, 40
heads, and $`d_{head}`$ equal to 5120/40 = 128 over its default
4096-token context, the per-token KV cache comes to approximately
0.78125 MiB. For the full 4096 token window, the KV cache size is about
3.125 GiB. When we increase batch size, the total memory footprint
scales linearly with each additional sequence adding a further ~0.78125
MiB per token.

We now understand that the KV cache prevents us from processing or
generating very long sequences (i.e. obstacle long context windows) and
from processing large batches and therefore from maximizing our hardware
efficiency.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none">
<img src="./paged_attention_assets/14_memlay.webp"
style="width:280px;max-width:none;display:block;margin:0 auto"
alt="memlay" /> On an NVIDIA A100 40 GB, a 13B FP16 model uses ≈26 GB
for weights, leaving ≈12 GB for the KV cache. With full multi-head
attention the KV per token is ≈0.8 MB, so the card can hold ≈15k tokens
of KV in total. With a 2048-token context window, that works out to ≈7
sequences resident at once. Prompt tokens simply consume part of the
2048 budget, so concurrency stays about the same while fewer new tokens
can be produced per sequence. The practical takeaway is that decode
throughput is capped by KV capacity. Paged KV caching is what we focus
on here, but KV quantisation (which I discuss in the appendix) and
alternative attention mechanisms that shrink the KV footprint also help.
</span>

Thats one issue, next we will see the memory fragmentation issue.

|-------------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Llama-2-7B  | 32       | 32      | 128    | 4096    |

### Fragmentation in continuous batching

![fragm](./paged_attention_assets/15_fragm.svg)

In addition to the huge size of the caches, early LLM serving systems
also handled memory allocations inefficiently. This is because during
inference, output sequence lengths are unknown in advance. You can
imagine this yourself when prompting: some prompts are short, others are
long, and each can generate either a long detailed output or a very
short one. Now scale this across thousands of users. To deal with this
uncertainty, serving platforms used to statically allocate a chunk of
memory for each request based on its maximum possible sequence length,
regardless of the actual input or the eventual output length. They did
this using preallocation schemes that ensured there was enough memory to
hold a request’s *potential* maximum KV cache size, even if that space
was never fully used.

The diagram above illustrates how the two types of fragmentation appear.
I adapted the figure from the paper but used the same example prompts we
have been following in this blog so it feels consistent. Here I call it
request A, with a very simple request B alongside it. In practice you
can imagine many more requests batched together of course. As you can
see, there are two primary sources of memory waste:

1.  Reserved slots for future tokens: If a generation finishes early and
    uses fewer tokens than the maximum, the remaining allocated memory
    stays unused but unavailable for others. This is **internal
    fragmentation**.
2.  **External fragmentation** from the memory allocator, such as the
    buddy allocator. This one is a little more subtle, so let us walk
    through an example.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/16_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

We start with 128 free bytes. Request A arrives needing 32 bytes. The
allocator keeps halving the bar until it can hand out 0 to 31, leaving
32 to 63 and 64 to 127 free. Request B needs 16 bytes. We carve it from
the right side, split 64 to 127, then 64 to 95, and allocate 64 to 79.
Now 80 to 95 and 96 to 127 are free, with the allocated block sitting in
between. Request C is tiny, just 7 bytes. The allocator splits 32 to 63
down to an 8 byte piece and allocates 32 to 39, leaving 1 byte inside
that piece unused (**internal fragmentation**). At this point the GPU
still has plenty of free memory in total: 40 to 47, 48 to 63, 80 to 95,
and 96 to 127, which add up to 72 bytes. But then a new long request
arrives that needs 64 bytes in one piece. Even though there is enough
free memory overall, there is no single contiguous block of that size,
since 64 to 79 is already occupied and the left side has been split into
smaller fragments. The allocation fails. This is **external
fragmentation**, and it is exactly the kind of waste that naive per
request KV slabs caused, since earlier LLM serving systems stored each
request’s KV cache in contiguous memory with preallocated slabs.

Both forms of fragmentation are pure waste. Even though reserved memory
is eventually consumed, holding it aside for the entire lifetime of a
request especially when the reserved space is large blocks other
requests from using it in the meantime.

## Paging as the Analogy

**Paged Attention** borrows directly from **virtual memory** and
**paging** in operating systems like Unix and Windows. Instead of
treating memory as one large block, the OS divides it into page frames
and only keeps the active parts in fast memory.

LLM serving faces the same problem with the KV cache. By paging it, we
can allocate memory more efficiently, avoid waste, and support much
longer contexts. Before getting into paged KV caching and paged
attention, I think it helps to quickly revisit this operating systems
analogy to later draw the mapping between both concepts.

### Operating Systems analogy

Memory pressure has always been a concern in computing. Software
generally tends to grow faster than memory, so systems needed a way to
run programs that were larger than available memory, and also to run
multiple programs at once whose combined size exceeded what could fit.
The proposed solution was therefore *virtual memory*.

The idea is that each program gets its own **virtual address space**,
divided into fixed-sized **pages**, while physical memory is divided
into **page frames** of the same size. A small mapping structure records
which virtual page currently lives in which physical frame, and because
of this indirection, a program can behave as if all of its memory were
present, while in reality the system only keeps the working set in fast
memory.

For example, imagine the instruction MOV REG,1000, where 1000 is some
computed virtual address. On a system without virtual memory, that
address is sent directly to the memory bus and the word at that position
is accessed. With virtual memory, things go first through the **memory
management unit (MMU)**, which consults the page
table<span class="sidenote-ref"></span> <span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none"> Mathematically speaking, the page table
is a function, with the virtual page number as argument and the physical
frame number as the output. </span>If the page is present, the access
succeeds immediately and is sent to the bus. If it is absent (which is
indicated through a hardware present/absent bit), the MMU triggers a
**page fault**, and the operating system fetches the missing page from
slower storage, places it into a free frame, updates the mapping, and
retries the instruction.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/17_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

I try to make this structure clear with my drawing, but I guess a simple
example on it could make things clearer. Suppose we have this 64 KB
virtual address space but only 32 KB of physical memory. The virtual
space is divided into 16 pages of 4 KB each, and physical memory into 8
frames of 4 KB. If the table says that virtual page 0 is currently in
frame 2, then any access in that page is redirected there. If virtual
page 2 is mapped to frame 6, it goes to frame 6. But if virtual page 8
is marked absent, the MMU raises a fault, the OS fetches that page from
disk into a frame, updates the mapping, and execution
continues.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none"> Because translations happen constantly,
systems need ways to make them fast. That’s where techniques like
translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) and multi-level page tables come
in. We won’t go deep into them here, but it’s useful to know they exist.
</span>

That’s all we need from the operating systems side. Virtual memory gives
the *illusion* of a large, continuous address space by mapping it onto a
smaller pool of fast memory and moving pages in and out as needed. Now
lets carry these concepts to paged KV caching and later paged attention.

### Paged KV Caching

Paged KV caching applies the same paging idea to the KV cache. Inside
vLLM, the **KV cache manager** is the heart of paged KV caching.
Essentially, the KV cache manager owns memory for keys and values and
the **scheduler** decides which requests advance each step. The key
difference then is that the cache manager does not hand each request one
giant contiguous buffer to store all of its keys and values. Instead, it
breaks the cache into fixed size **KV blocks** measured in tokens per
block akin to pages as we saw before, keeps a **global free block
pool**, which you can think of as a doubly linked list, and gives each
request a small **block table** that maps its logical blocks to physical
blocks (a.k.a page frames) in GPU memory. When a request grows, new
blocks are taken from the pool and appended to its table. When a request
finishes, its blocks go back to the pool and can be reused immediately
by any other request.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/18_vllm.svg" style="width:80.0%"
alt="vllm" />

</div>

The top part is the **engine** view which I have adapted from [Aleksa's
post](https://www.aleksagordic.com/blog/vllm). Requests come in, the
processor prepares them turning raw input into a suitable request format
i.e tokenisation, the scheduler picks which ones to run, and the KV
cache manager sits in the middle coordinating memory. The middle part is
the indexing structure on the CPU side we talked about, which we can
think of as a doubly linked list of available block identifiers managed
by the cache manager and the bottom view is the real KV data on the GPU,
stored as many equal sized blocks. The block table is the bridge which
are also maintained by the KV cache manager. Block table is the main
table used to map logical KV blocks to their computed KV cache blocks
even when the physical blocks are actually scattered.

At initialisation the engine measures how much VRAM is available for
cache, chooses a token block size $`B`$, and computes how many blocks
fit. For a standard transformer layer the bytes per block are:

``` math
bytes = 2\times B\times num\_ kv\_ heads\times head\_ size\times bytes
```

The factor two accounts for keys and values. With GQA or MQA,
num_kv_heads becomes smaller, so each block becomes lighter and more
blocks fit in the same memory.

During execution vLLM allocates just in time rather than predicting the
full future length. In each engine step the scheduler decides which
requests advance, then asks the KV cache manager to reserve blocks only
for the tokens processed in this step. For prefill the number of new
tokens is known upfront, so the manager allocates
$`\lceil N\div B\rceil`$ blocks for a prompt of $`N`$ tokens. For decode
the step usually adds a single token<span class="sidenote-ref"></span>
<span class="sidenote" style="counter-increment:none">  
In V1 the engine scheduler can mix both prefill and decoding stages in
the same step. In V0, which I am following here for simplification and
to keep consistency with Aleksa's work, only one of the two can happen
at any time.  
</span>. The manager checks the remaining free slots in the last logical
block and allocates a new block only when that block would overflow in
this step. Similarly, when a request completes, its blocks are returned
to the pool. Because every block has the same size, any returned block
can satisfy any future block request.

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/19_transformers.webp"
style="width:60.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

![pagedkv](./paged_attention_assets/20_pagedkv.gif)

These two diagrams show a simple prompt and how that would look like
from the logical and physical memory view and how they are mapped in the
block table. Suppose the prompt has 7 tokens and $`B = 4`$. We need
$`\lceil 7\div 4\rceil = 2`$ KV blocks. The manager pops two identifiers
from the free pool and writes them into the request’s block table. Each
entry tracks the physical block id, a small reference count, and often a
block hash. The reference count enables memory sharing. When two
requests share an identical prefix, they both point to the same physical
blocks and the counts increase. No copying is needed, we will see this
next. During decode, new tokens are written into the next free slots.
When the last block fills, one more block is appended and the table
grows by one entry.

A crucial note to make clear: blocks are read shared, write unique. A
physical KV block is write owned by a single request. You never let an
unrelated request place a token into the spare slot of someone else’s
block. If two requests share an identical prefix they can both read the
same blocks, and the reference counts increase. The moment one of them
needs to append, the cache manager allocates a fresh block for that
request, which is effectively copy on write at block granularity. As you
realise, that means there can be some small unused tails within the
final block of a request, which is **internal fragmentation**, but that
is bounded by at most $`B - 1`$ token slots per request, not the whole
context length if you remember from before. The block size **$`B - 1`$**
trades pointer chasing against packing efficiency. Larger blocks reduce
lookups but make reuse coarser. Smaller blocks increase flexibility and
reduce unused slots in the last block, at the cost of a few more
lookups.

This is an example of how memory sharing would look like with initially
two prompts that share the same prefix or prompt. When later they want
to produce new tokens the cache manager allocates a fresh block for that
request and does a copy on write, copying the same KV caches to another
area which then allows each request to have its own "copy" and block
which is used to place its new tokens.

![memshare](./paged_attention_assets/21_memshare.gif)

This layout directly fixes what we saw earlier. **Internal
fragmentation** shrinks because the system never reserves worst case
slabs. It allocates only the blocks that are actually used, one block at
a time as decode progresses. **External fragmentation** largely
disappears because allocation is always in identical blocks, so free
space does not turn into unusable holes. Any free block can be assigned
to any request, and the block table hides the fact that blocks are
scattered.

There are also practical wins for batching and decoding. Continuous
batching is smoother because requests of very different lengths can be
mixed without wasting memory. Memory sharing avoids duplication and is
cheap to represent. If you sample multiple completions from the same
prompt or run beams that share an early prefix, all those paths can
share the same physical prefix blocks and diverge only when new tokens
are produced. The block table simply points more than one request to the
same read only blocks, which saves memory without copying. Finally,
paging gives a clear behaviour under pressure. If the pool runs out of
free blocks when the scheduler wants to advance a batch, the system can
pause new prefill work, evict lower priority requests by returning their
blocks to the pool, or fall back to recompute strategies where
acceptable. All of these choices happen at the level of KV blocks, which
keeps the policy simple and predictable.

## Paged Attention Mechanism

**PagedAttention** is the compute side that makes paged KV caching
actually work. Classic attention assumes the keys and values for a
sequence sit in one contiguous buffer. PagedAttention removes that
assumption. It cuts the cache for each request into equal sized KV
blocks as we saw previously, then drives attention by following the
request’s block table so that blocks can live anywhere in GPU memory
while the maths remains identical to standard attention.

Here is a simple example with the query token *soon*. The past tokens of
this sequence are spread across three different KV blocks:

- Block 1 stores sing, calm, night, bring
- Block 3 stores peace, soon
- Block 7 stores Sun, sets, low, bid

<div style="text-align:center">

<img src="./paged_attention_assets/22_transformers.svg"
style="width:80.0%" alt="Transformers" />

</div>

Even though these tokens live in non-contiguous memory, the block table
ensures the kernel can still traverse them in the correct logical order
and compute attention as if they were all next to each other in a single
buffer.

The blocks are numbered $`j = 1,2,3,\ldots`$. Block $`j`$ simply
contains the keys and values for the $`B`$ tokens whose positions fall
in that range:

``` math
K_{j} = \left\lbrack k_{(j - 1)B + 1},\ldots,k_{jB} \right\rbrack,\qquad V_{j} = \left\lbrack v_{(j - 1)B + 1},\ldots,v_{jB} \right\rbrack.
```

So $`K_{1}`$ holds the first $`B`$ keys of the sequence, $`K_{2}`$ holds
the next $`B`$, and so on. $`V_{j}`$ is the same idea for values.

For the current query token $`i`$ with query vector $`q_{i}`$ and head
dimension $`d`$, we can compute attention by visiting these blocks one
by one. Written in block form:

``` math
A_{ij}\; = \;\frac{\exp\!\left( q_{i}^{\top}K_{j}\,/\,\sqrt{d} \right)}{\sum_{t = 1}^{\lceil i/B\rceil}\exp\!\left( q_{i}^{\top}K_{t}\,/\,\sqrt{d} \right)},
```

 

``` math
o_{i}\; = \;\sum_{j = 1}^{\lceil i/B\rceil}V_{j}\, A_{ij}^{\top}.
```

Here $`A_{ij} = \left( a_{i,(j - 1)B + 1},\ldots,a_{i,jB} \right)`$ is
the vector of attention weights for the tokens inside block $`j`$. The
vector $`o_{i}`$ is the usual attention output for token $`i`$.

What the kernel does is straightforward. It walks the request’s block
table in logical order. For each block $`j`$ it looks up where that
block lives in GPU memory, loads the keys $`K_{j}`$, forms the partial
scores

``` math
q_{i}^{\top}K_{j}/\sqrt{d},
```

updates a **running softmax
normaliser**<span class="sidenote-ref"></span>  
<span class="sidenote" style="counter-increment:none">I couldn't find
more info on whether that is exactly the same as the online softmax used
in [Flash Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08691), but it is likely
very similar.</span> that spans all seen blocks, then multiplies the
normalised weights with the values $`V_{j}`$ and adds the result into
$`o_{i}`$. Because the softmax runs across several blocks, the kernel
keeps a running maximum and a running sum while it streams. This gives
exactly the same numbers you would get if all keys and values sat in one
contiguous array.

Now let’s see some numbers to understand what this approach optimised
for:

Previous systems wasted **60%–80%** of the KV cache memory, whereas vLLM
achieves near-optimal memory usage with less than **4%** waste. Because
of this improved memory efficiency, we can require fewer GPUs to achieve
the same output, so throughput is significantly higher than that of
other inference engines. This virtual memory-inspired attention design
therefore bounds **internal fragmentation** by the size of the blocks
and eliminates **external fragmentation**. The following plot from the
paper shows the different types of memory waste for the same model
across three different serving systems compared to vLLM’s paged
attention:

</div>

Before concluding, it is important to note a caveat when applying the
virtual memory and paging technique to other GPU workloads. The idea of
virtual memory and paging is effective for managing the KV cache in LLM
serving because the workload requires dynamic memory allocation and
performance is bound by GPU memory capacity. However, this does not
generally hold for every other AI workload. In DNN training, the tensor
shapes are typically static, so memory allocation can be optimised ahead
of time. In serving DNNs that are not LLMs, an increase in memory
efficiency may not result in performance gains since the workload is
primarily compute-bound. In such scenarios, introducing vLLM’s
techniques could even degrade performance due to the extra overhead of
memory indirection and non-contiguous block access. That said, it would
still be exciting to see these techniques applied to other workloads
with properties similar to LLM serving.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Appendix: Other Inference Optimisation Techniques

### Static vs Continous Batching

Batching helps mitigate the memory bandwidth constraints LLMs face,
since they often waste a lot of GPU compute by shuttling data and
loading parameters. Instead of loading model parameters for every
request, you load them once and use them to process many input sequences
or requests. This uses the chip memory bandwidth more efficiently,
leading to higher compute utilisation, higher throughput, and cheaper
LLM inference.

**Static batching** is the traditional style, where the server waits
until a fixed number of requests arrive and then processes them together
as a single batch. It is called static because the batch size stays
constant until inference completes.

- The first request in a batch is forced to wait for the last one,
  adding unnecessary delay. Picture a printer that won’t start printing
  until you’ve queued up a set number of documents, regardless of how
  long it takes for the last document to arrive.

- Not all requests in a batch are created equal. In LLM inference, some
  requests may generate very short responses, while others could involve
  lengthy, step-by-step reasoning. Since all requests in the batch must
  wait until the slowest one finishes, this can lead to wasted compute
  resources and increased latency.

Without restrictive assumptions on user input and model output lengths,
unoptimised production grade LLM systems cannot serve traffic without
underutilising GPUs and incurring unnecessary cost. We need to optimise
how we serve LLMs for their power to be broadly accessible.

![StaticBatching](./paged_attention_assets/24_staticbatching.webp)

Instead of waiting until every sequence in a batch has finished
generation, in the paper [Orca: A Distributed Serving System for
Transformer Based Generative
Models](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi22/presentation/yu) they
implement **iteration level scheduling** where the batch size is chosen
per iteration. The result is that once a sequence in a batch has
finished generation, a new sequence can be inserted in its place,
yielding higher GPU utilisation than static batching. There is sometimes
confusion in the literature that calls this dynamic, but **continuous**
fits better, with **dynamic** reserved for a different
strategy.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none">
![BatchingTypes](./paged_attention_assets/25_batchingtypes.svg) In
**static batching** the server waits until a fixed number of requests
arrive and then processes them together as a single batch. **Dynamic
batching** still collects incoming requests into batches, but it does
not insist on a fixed batch size. Instead it uses a time window and
processes whatever arrives in that window. If the batch hits its size
limit sooner, it launches immediately. This is like a bus that leaves on
a strict schedule or whenever it is full, whichever comes first.
**Continuous batching** does not wait for all sequences in a batch to
finish, it groups sequences at the iteration level. </span> .If you are
interested, this blog post: [How continuous batching enables 23x
throughput in LLM inference while reducing p50
latency](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/continuous-batching-llm-inference),
explains this in more detail. Thanks to the authors as well for
providing the figures above that help visualise these strategies.

![Continous-batching](./paged_attention_assets/26_continous-batching.webp)

### Speculative Decoding

The vanilla generation process outputs only one token at a time at each
decoding step. The main point however is that to generate K tokens, you
would need to do K forward passes of the model, and as explained in the
post this is sequential by nature which doesn’t again utilise compute
resources well as step t+1 depends on generations up until step t.

So, token generation time increases linearly. That actually also ties to
the different batching strategies explained above, because in the static
batching scenarios, throughput is bottlenecked by this linear growth. So
more supporting arguments for why continuous batching mitigates this
bottleneck.

The larger the LLM, the more competent it can be. However, these larger
models are also slower, as each decoding step needs to read the entirety
of the model’s weights.

The team from Google Research therefore proposed **speculative
decoding** in [Fast Inference from Transformers via Speculative
Decoding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.17192). The algorithm speeds up
generation for autoregressive models by computing several tokens in
parallel through a draft "smaller" model which proposes several draft
tokens ahead and a larger model which then verifies these proposed
tokens in parallel and accepts those that match its own predictions.

This approach was inspired from two key observations:

1.  Some tokens are easier to generate than others: Many next tokens are
    obvious from context and can be proposed by a smaller model.
2.  The bottleneck for inference is usually memory not compute.

Speculative decoding is inspired by an optimisation technique called
**speculative execution**, which was generalised further
probabilistically and applied to autoregressive models. Briefly:

- **Speculative execution**: Let’s assume we have two slow steps: first
  compute $`Y = f(X)`$, then compute $`Z = g(Y)`$. Normally, we can’t
  start $`g(Y)`$ until we know $`Y`$, forcing strict serial dependence.
  Speculative execution says “What if I can *guess* $`Y`$ using a
  **cheap approximation** $`f^{}(X)`$, then start $`g(f^{}(X))`$ in
  parallel?” Once the original $`f(X)`$ finishes, I check the guess. If
  it matches, I saved time by parallelising something that was
  originally serial. If it doesn’t, I discard the speculative work and
  fall back to the original. Either way, correctness is guaranteed, but
  when the guesser is good, we gain significant speedup.

- **Speculative sampling**: LLMs don’t produce a single next token, but
  rather a probability distribution from which we sample the next token
  (side note: think softmax over the vocabulary). This makes the output
  stochastic, not deterministic. So this new method extends the above by
  introducing a probabilistic acceptance rule. At each step we have
  $`f(X)`$, the true distribution from the large model, and
  $`f^{*}(X)`$, an approximate distribution from a smaller model. We let
  the draft sample a token and immediately start downstream computation
  with it. There’s a caveat, though: because the output is stochastic,
  we can’t just accept if the draft and target happen to pick the same
  token. With vocabularies in the tens of thousands, that would almost
  always fail, wasting work.

- **Speculative decoding**: Speculative sampling fixes this by
  introducing a **probabilistic filter**. When the draft model samples a
  token, we check how much probability the large model assigns to that
  token. If the large model also thinks it’s likely, we accept the
  draft’s choice with high probability. If the large model thinks it’s
  less likely, we reject more often and fall back to resampling directly
  from the large
  model<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
  style="counter-increment:none">
  ![](./paged_attention_assets/27_image.webp) The baseline (dotted line)
  corresponds to naïve decoding: always one token per step. With
  speculative decoding, as α increases (draft guesses are more often
  correct) and as γ grows, the effective tokens per iteration rises
  significantly. For example, with γ = ∞ and α close to 0.9, the system
  can generate nearly 10 tokens per iteration, compared to just 1 in the
  baseline. We just gained free parallelism! Better draft models and
  larger lookaheads directly translate into higher speedups. </span>.
  With this approach, we are guaranteed that despite the lower cost, the
  generated samples come from exactly the same probability distribution
  as those produced by naïve decoding.

For more details and examples, Google Research also put out this [blog
post](https://research.google/blog/looking-back-at-speculative-decoding/)
to explain the concept in more detail.

In the original paper, **speculative decoding** demonstrated a **2×–3×**
wall-time speedup on models like T5-XXL, while maintaining identical
output distributions.

### Quantisation

Another very important and heavily researched optimisation direction is
also **quantisation**. State-of-the-art models nowadays are casually in
the order of billions of parameters. To put this into perspective,
[Hunyuan-Large](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02265), an open-source
Mixture-of-Experts model, has **389 billion total parameters** with only
**52 billion active per inference step**—“only,” I say
sarcastically—that is still massive. DeepSeek-V3 has **671 billion total
parameters**, with about **37 billion active** during token generation.
You get the point.

Even though active parameters are much smaller than the total weights,
inference still requires **all parameters in memory** (for example, GPU
VRAM) since different experts are chosen for every layer and every
token. This means the total model size sets the minimum memory
requirement. A natural direction, then, is to make models smaller so
they require less memory. But what does “smaller” mean?

Parameters are usually stored as **floating-point numbers**, and
inference involves huge amounts of floating-point operations (FLOPs).
There are different floating-point precisions. Intuitively, by lowering
the precision we massively reduce memory usage, albeit at the potential
cost of accuracy. Finding that balance is a major research focus. Before
continuing, it makes sense to point out the main floating-point
precisions: <span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none">
![](./paged_attention_assets/29_image.svg) </span>

![precisions](./paged_attention_assets/30_precisions.svg)

There are others too, but these are the main ones. In practice,
quantisation today often uses **integer-based
formats**<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none">
![ranges](./paged_attention_assets/31_ranges.webp) The more bits used to
represent a value, the more precise it is. A larger range is covered and
the distance between neighbouring values is smaller—hence higher
precision. </span>.

Inference also needs memory beyond just weights (e.g. the KV we have
been talking about until now), but let’s see how much memory DeepSeek-V3
would need solely to load the full weights ignoring the cache for now:

``` math
\text{Memory} = \frac{\text{No.~of~Bits}}{8}\times\text{No.~of~Parameters}
```
  
``` math
64\ \text{bits} = \frac{64}{8}\times 671\ \text{B} \approx 5,368\ \text{GB}
```
  
``` math
32\ \text{bits} = \frac{32}{8}\times 671\ \text{B} \approx 2,684\ \text{GB}
```
  
``` math
16\ \text{bits} = \frac{16}{8}\times 671\ \text{B} \approx 1,342\ \text{GB}
```
  
``` math
8\ \text{bits} = \frac{8}{8}\times 671\ \text{B} \approx 671\ \text{GB}
```
  
``` math
4\ \text{bits} = \frac{4}{8}\times 671\ \text{B} \approx 335.5\ \text{GB}
```

Clearly, no GPU can hold 1,342 GB. In practice, inference is distributed
across thousands of GPUs using methods like **tensor parallelism** and
**pipeline parallelism**. I won’t dive into those here, but they’re
worthwhile topics. What you can clearly see here however, is that just
by reducing precision, memory needs shrink drastically. Beyond memory
savings, integer formats like int8 or int4 may even be faster than
floating-point on some
hardware<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none"> On NVIDIA H100 Tensor Cores, peak INT8
throughput reaches ~2000 TOPS compared to ~1000 TFLOPS for FP16/BF16.
</span>.

#### Quantisation mapping

The main idea is that we want to take floats in some big range
$`\lbrack\alpha,\beta\rbrack`$ and squash them into integers in a
smaller range $`\lbrack\alpha_{q},\beta_{q}\rbrack`$. For signed INT8,
for example, that range is $`\lbrack - 128,127\rbrack`$. To make this
work, we assume a straight-line relationship between the float $`x`$ and
its quantised integer $`x_{q}`$. For more detail checkout [Lei
Mao’s](https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/)
blog post where he goes in depth into this. It helped me understand this
more clearly:

``` math
x = c(x_{q} + d)
```

Here $`c`$ is the scale, i.e how many float units each integer step
covers, and $`d`$ is just an offset. If we want to go the other way
(float to integer), we flip the line and round:

``` math
x_{q} = {round}\!\left( \frac{x}{c} - d \right)
```

The line has to hit the ends of both ranges, so we require:

``` math
\beta = c(\beta_{q} + d),\qquad\alpha = c(\alpha_{q} + d)
```

Subtracting these two equations gives:

``` math
\beta - \alpha = c(\beta_{q} + d) - c(\alpha_{q} + d)
```

Using distributive law:

``` math
\beta - \alpha = c(\beta_{q} - \alpha_{q})
```

which means:

``` math
c = \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_{q} - \alpha_{q}}
```

Once we know $`c`$, we can plug it back into
$`\alpha = c(\alpha_{q} + d)`$ to get $`d`$:

``` math
\alpha = c\alpha_{q} + cd
```
``` math
d = \frac{\alpha}{c} - \alpha_{q}
```

and replacing $`c`$ gives:

``` math
d = \alpha\frac{\beta_{q} - \alpha_{q}}{\beta - \alpha} - \alpha_{q} = \frac{\alpha\beta_{q} - \beta\alpha_{q}}{\beta - \alpha}
```

That’s the general form tho. In practice libraries usually call
$`s = c`$ the **scale** and $`z = - d`$ the **zero point**, and the
final formulas you actually use look like this:

``` math
x = s(x_{q} - z)
```
``` math
x_{q} = {round}\!\left( \frac{x}{s} + z \right)
```

with

``` math
s = \frac{\beta - \alpha}{\beta_{q} - \alpha_{q}},\qquad z = {round}\!\left( \alpha_{q} - \frac{\alpha}{s} \right)
```

Let's run this through an example visually to map the concepts better
assuming we having a vector of 5 weights that are represented in FP32
and we would want to quantise to
int8.<span class="sidenote-ref"></span><span class="sidenote"
style="counter-increment:none"> In practice we do not map the entire
precision range in FP32 for thats \[-3.4e38, 3.4e38\] into INT8.
Instead, we take the actual data we want to store, find its minimum and
maximum, and fit that interval into the INT8 code range. </span>

![quant](./paged_attention_assets/32_quant.svg)

#### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Quantisation

Notice the difference. In **asymmetric quantisation** we use the true
data range, so $`\alpha`$ is the minimum of the tensor and $`\beta`$ is
the maximum. That choice gives a non-zero 0 point in code space, which
is why in the first example 0 in float was stored as the code $`21`$. We
also use the full set of INT8 codes end to end. In **symmetric
quantisation** we centre the float range around 0 by taking $`a`$ to be
the larger of the absolute min and max, then map the interval from
$`- a`$ to $`+ a`$ onto a perfectly centred code range with zero point
$`z = 0`$.

Comparing the two modes:

With asymmetric quantisation we pin the real minimum to the smallest
code and the real maximum to the largest code, so the data is spread
across all buckets. Nothing is wasted. With symmetric quantisation we
force the float interval to sit around zero. If the tensor is mostly on
one side, many buckets represent values you will never see. The extreme
case is after ReLU where everything is non negative. Asymmetric uses all
256 codes across the useful region. Symmetric keeps 128 codes for
negatives that never appear.

In asymmetric mode however, the zero points require additional logic in
hardware. That extra handling can add a little latency and complexity,
depending on the implementation.
